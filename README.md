# gitradar

Helicopter view on the file changes with time dimension.

If you have a x x x x situation for some file, it means youâ€™ve been editing it all the time. 

Practically it means the file is most likely complex and might need splitting up or total rewrite. Or you could plan your work into better bigger tasks to do stuff properly at once.

As an alternative for listing changed files with git diff, this gives wider view on the same go.

See below demo Gif on real world usage.
# Usage

```
./gitradar.sh path-to-your-git-repo
```

# Install

Go to panwid/ and run   `python3 setup.py install`

venv can be used to avoid install all the dependencies into global Python space. gitradar.sh is a helper which launches it using python from venv. There is a requirements.txt for getting couple of packages installed.



## Advanced config

If wanting to enrich columns with env names, e.g. 2.0.0 *instance1*,
instead of plain versions, please customize env mapping:

```
    cp src/customizedenvs.py{.template,}
```

And then modify that customizedenvs.py to do your mapping.

## Contribute

Documentation, flexibility, etc. needs to be improved.
